🧠 Comprehensive Explanation of the Experiment

This experiment focuses on evaluating the fairness and bias of an AI text classification model. By analyzing linguistic data labeled by gender, it aims to uncover implicit associations that may influence model predictions. The experiment demonstrates how ethical evaluation frameworks can expose structural biases hidden within seemingly neutral algorithms.

✏️ Objective

The main objective is to identify gender bias in a simple text classifier by training it on a small dataset containing both male  and female associated descriptions. Through model inspection, the experiment reveals whether certain gendered terms are unfairly linked to positive or negative classifications.

📘 Results

The results showed that the model tends to assign higher positive weights to male-related terms such as “leader” and “ambitious,” while associating female-related words like “emotional” and “caring” with neutral or negative outputs. This behavior highlights the ethical importance of balanced datasets and the need for algorithmic fairness adjustments to ensure unbiased decision-making.

📗 Observations


The experiment proves that bias can emerge even in small-scale datasets.


Ethical evaluation should be integrated at every stage of model development, from data collection to deployment.


Adjusting word distributions, applying fairness metrics, and reviewing linguistic features are essential steps toward responsible AI design.


Continuous auditing helps maintain transparency, trust, and alignment with human values across AI systems.
